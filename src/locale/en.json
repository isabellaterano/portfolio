    "about.me": "Hello! I'm Jasper Everett, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a knack for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. My journey in the world of coding began several years ago, and since then, I've honed my skills across a wide range of technologies, enabling me to bring innovative ideas to life on both the front-end and back-end. When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, playing guitar, or indulging in my love for cooking. I believe that a balanced life fuels creativity and productivity.
